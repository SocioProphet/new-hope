# Roadmap

Immediate hardening (no fluff):

1) Canonicalization RFC: exact hashing/serialization rules and signing coverage.
2) Membrane decision model: standardized outputs (allow/deny/quarantine/redact/require-signature) + required audit fields.
3) Protocol registry bundling: versioned protocol pack artifacts with content hashes.
4) Workflow harness: FA representation + replay checkpoints + deterministic execution receipts.
5) TritRPC fixtures: canonical frame fixtures for cross-language interoperability tests.
