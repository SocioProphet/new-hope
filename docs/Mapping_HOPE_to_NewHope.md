# Mapping HOPE → New Hope

This document preserves HOPE lineage while adding the missing enforcement, provenance, nondeterminism, and governance semantics required for a modern commons.

## Core mappings
- Receptor → Receptor (add manifest + sandbox + determinism class)
- Carrier/Semantic Type → Carrier/Protocol (add signing + policy_context + content addressing)
- Membrane → Membrane (make enforcement mandatory and testable)
- FA workflows → FA workflows + conformance harness + replay checkpoints
- Semantic DB receptor → Hybrid store receptor (event log + graph + lexical + vector + LSH)

## What New Hope adds (the missing bones)
- First-class provenance (content hashes + signatures + lineage)
- Enforcement-grade membranes (redact/quarantine/deny + egress + quotas + cross-tenant constraints)
- Explicit nondeterminism model for LLM/tool behavior
- News/messaging primitives (threads/claims/citations/lenses/moderation/appeals)
- Federation semantics (controlled cross-system relays + trace continuity)
