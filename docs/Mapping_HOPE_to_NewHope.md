# Mapping HOPE → New Hope

| HOPE concept | New Hope equivalent | Upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| Receptor | Receptor | add capability manifest + sandbox profile + determinism class |
| Carrier + Semantic Type | Carrier + Protocol | add content addressing, signatures, provenance, policy_context |
| Membrane | Membrane | make it enforcement, not just routing |
| FA user processes | Workflow automata | add replay checkpoints + conformance harness |
| Semantic DB receptor | Hybrid store receptor | event log + graph + lexical + vector + LSH sidecar |

This preserves HOPE’s compositional model while making trust/governance/audit non-optional.
